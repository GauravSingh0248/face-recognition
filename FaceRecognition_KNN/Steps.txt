# Project Face Recognition
=============================

1. Collect data of various person 
    -- Asking Multiple people to come in front of webcam ,  click 20 each pictures of each
    -- Store the part if the image containing the face  (Haarcascade to detect the face)

2. Train a classifier to learn who is the person ( Classification )
    -- Load the training Data (.mpy arrays)
    -- Store the data and target values (labels)

3. Predicting the name of the person 
    -- Read the video stream 
    -- Extract the face out of it 
    -- predict the label for that face
        -- logistic regression ( parametric algorithm )
        -- neural network
        -- K-NN (non-parametric look for similarity in nearest neighbours)
